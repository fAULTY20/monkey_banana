# 🍌 Monkey-Banana Problem - AI Search Solution 🐒  

This repository contains an **AI-based search algorithm** to solve the **Monkey-Banana Problem** using **state-space search techniques** like **DFS, BFS, and A* algorithms**.  

## 📖 **Problem Statement**  
A monkey in a room wants to grab a banana hanging from the ceiling. The monkey can:  
✅ **Move left or right** 🏃  
✅ **Climb onto a box** 📦  
✅ **Grab the banana when on the box** 🍌  

The goal is to determine **the sequence of actions** for the monkey to get the banana.

## ⚙️ **Implementation Details**  
### 🧠 **AI Techniques Used**  
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**  
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**  
- **A* Search Algorithm** (with heuristic optimization)  

### 🔥 **Features**  
✅ **State representation** (Monkey’s position, box position, banana position)  
✅ **Graph search algorithms** to find the optimal solution  
✅ **Animated visualization using Pygame** 🎮
